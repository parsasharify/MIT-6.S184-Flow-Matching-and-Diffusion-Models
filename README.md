# MIT-6.S184-Flow-Matching-and-Diffusion-Models

This repository contains my implementations and solutions for the MIT 6.S184: Flow Matching and Diffusion Models course. The code is based on the official lectures and homework assignments, with a focus on understanding the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details of modern diffusion-based generative models.

📚 Course Overview

6.S184: Flow Matching and Diffusion Models is an MIT course covering the theory and practice of diffusion models, score-based generative modeling, and flow matching methods. Topics include:

Diffusion and score-based generative models

Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and probability flow ODEs

Flow matching objectives

Training and sampling procedures

Connections between diffusion models, normalizing flows, and optimal transport

This repository reflects my hands-on work throughout the course.

🧠 What’s Included

Implementations of core diffusion and flow-matching algorithms

Homework solutions aligned with the course assignments

Training and sampling code for generative models

Experiments and visualizations used to validate model behavior
